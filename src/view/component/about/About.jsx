          We run our outreaches on a yearly basis, with this being our third edition - we have had the privilege of contributing to the Makoko community, the Pacelli School for the Blind, and the Wesley School for the Hearing¬†Impaired.
          We want them to know that we and many others are rooting for them; we believe in them; and we will keep cheering them on as they progress towards greater heights beyond societal¬†limitations.‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ
