          of our community, partners, and supporters, <br />
          channeling their generosity towards enabling the disadvantaged to access quality education, 
          encouraging them to grow holistically, and empowering them to lead!

          expand their educational horizon, and boost their fighting chance for a bright future and afford them a competitive advantage in these 
          technological times.

          <h1>Our Mission</h1>
          We run our outreaches on a yearly basis, with this being our third edition - we have had the privilege of contributing to the Makoko community, the Pacelli School for the Blind, and the Wesley School for the Hearing¬†Impaired.
          We want them to know that we and many others are rooting for them; we believe in them; and we will keep cheering them on as they progress towards greater heights beyond societal¬†limitations.‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ
